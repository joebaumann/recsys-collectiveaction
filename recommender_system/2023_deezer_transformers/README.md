# Deezer recommender system

This directory contains the code to retrain the deezer recommender system on the [Spotify Million Playlist Dataset](https://www.aicrowd.com/challenges/spotify-million-playlist-dataset-challenge).

This code has been slightly adapted for the collective action experiments from [here](https://github.com/deezer/APC-RTA).
It has been made publically available by Deezer Research along with their SIGIR 2023 paper [A Scalable Framework for Automatic Playlist Continuation on Music Streaming Services](https://sigir.org/sigir2023/) by Bendada et al.
